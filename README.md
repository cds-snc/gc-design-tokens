# GC Design System Tokens

GC Design System Tokens are the smallest building blocks of the design system. They represent design decisions for basic elements like colour, typography, and spacing, creating a curated set of options that we base our designs on.

Tokens replace hard-coded values with variables that can be reused throughout the entire code base which makes it easier to maintain and update any code. Our tokens help us create a consistent visual experience that meets the Government of Canada requirements. They also improve communication between design and development by establishing a shared language.
<br/>
<br/>
## Tools

We are using [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) to build our tokens.
<br/>
<br/>
## Installation

- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/cds-snc/gcds-tokens`.
- Run `npm install` to install all Node.js dependencies.
- Run `npm run build` to build the tokens.
